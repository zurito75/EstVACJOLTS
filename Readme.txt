Readme
With this code, you can reproduce the results of the paper:
Estimating Vacancy Stocks from Aggregated Data on Hires: A Methodology to Study Frictions in the Labor Market
You will find two data files needed to execute the code: (JOLTS.xls and ce.data.0.AllCESSeries.txt); both are publicly available from the JOLTS website.

Execute the files in the following order:

0.1 Data
0.2. Panel
1.2. Method_Hires_AIC_boots_3
3. Graphs

You do not need to execute file 1.2. Method_Hires_AIC_boots_3 because it is internally executed in the third file.

The fourth file needs to run the x12 seasonal adjustment algorithm, which needs to be previously installed in Stata.
